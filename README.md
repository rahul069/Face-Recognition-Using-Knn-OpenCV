# Introduction
Face recognition is a crucial security application. Through this project,  a very basic form of face recognition has been implemented using the Haar Cascades Classifier, openCV & K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm.

## Technology Stack
Python - The whole code has been written in Python
cv2 -  cv2 is the OpenCV module and is used here for reading & writing images & also to input a video stream
Algorithm - KNN
Classifier - Haar Cascades

## How it works!
* Run generating selfie training data.ipynb.The script will open a camera window.Stand in front of the camera until recording of the face is completed.Input the person's name. Press q after having enough samples.
* The default file where the features are stored is name.npy.
* Run the Building Face Classifier.ipynb file!
